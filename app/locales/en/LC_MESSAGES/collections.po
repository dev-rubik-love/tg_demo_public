# Long comments for line: "Plural-Forms: nplurals=2; plural=(n != 1);\n"
# 1) Reason for the rule:
# English, like many other languages, has a grammatical system for expressing quantity.
# Singular and plural are grammatical numbers that potentially impact all parts of speech.
# It is essential to correctly translate these nuances to maintain the naturalness of the language in software.
#
# 2) Workflow and specification:
# We use the "Plural-Forms" attribute to provide gettext with the rules for pluralization in English.
# This attribute helps gettext understand how to select the correct translation depending on the numerical context.
# The "nplurals" parameter is used to specify the total number of grammatical numbers in the language, which is 2 for English.
# The "plural" condition provides the logic to select between these forms based on the given quantity.
#
# 3) Implementation:
# The condition "n != 1" in the "plural" attribute means if the quantity `n` is not equal to 1, use the plural form.
# When `n` equals 1, it means we are dealing with a singular entity, so we use the singular form.
